            upfront fees for the skill-based programs. Instead, they will share
            a percentage of their annual salary after they complete the program
            and secure employment. The percentage of income to be shared and the
            duration of the sharing period will be outlined in the ISA

            a job.

            of literary, artistic, musical, or any other form of creative work.

            For Salaryfy, a company that provides job growth opportunities and

            original content and courses for its users. Therefore, IPR laws are
            necessary to protect Salaryfy's proprietary content and prevent
            competitors from copying or stealing its intellectual property.

            There are several types of IPR that apply to Salaryfy, including
            patents, trademarks, copyrights, and trade secrets. Each of these

            Patents are legal rights granted to inventors that protect their
            inventions from being copied, sold, or used without permission. For
            Salaryfy, this could mean patenting its proprietary software or
            technology used in creating its courses. By obtaining patents,
            Salaryfy can prevent others from using or copying its technology,
            thereby securing its competitive advantage.

            Trademarks are symbols, logos, or designs that identify and

            reputation. Salaryfy's logo and name are its trademarks, and it is

            In addition to protecting its intellectual property, Salaryfy must

            must not infringe on the patents, trademarks, copyrights, or trade
            secrets of other companies. Failure to respect IPR can result in
            legal action, damages, and reputational harm.

            includes checking if there are any existing patents or copyrights
            that could be infringed upon. Additionally, Salaryfy should ensure
            that it obtains the necessary licenses or permissions to use any

            includes providing the author's name and copyright information in
            the course materials. By giving proper credit, Salaryfy can avoid
            claims of copyright infringement and maintain its reputation as a
            responsible and ethical company.

            Third-party intellectual property rights refer to the intellectual
            property owned by others and used by a company like Salaryfy in its
            operations. Third-party intellectual property rights can include
            patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, and other
            proprietary information. As a company that provides job growth
            opportunities and courses for skill placement, Salaryfy must be

            Salaryfy, this could mean using patented technology owned by others
            in its courses. To avoid infringing on third-party patents, Salaryfy
            should conduct thorough research before using any technology in its
            courses. This includes checking if there are any existing patents

            thorough research before using any confidential information. This
            includes checking if the information is protected by a

            For example, if Salaryfy obtains a license to use third-party

            third-party intellectual property rights. If Salaryfy discovers that
            it has infringed on third-party intellectual property rights, it
            should take immediate steps to rectify the situation, such as

            The limited license rights granted by Salaryfy are important for
            several reasons. First, they protect the company's intellectual
            property rights. By limiting the way in which users can use its
            products and services, Salaryfy ensures that its proprietary
            information and content are not misused or exploited. This helps to
            maintain the quality and integrity of the services that it provides.

            Second, limited license rights help to ensure that users get the

            on how its products and services can be used, the company ensures
            that its users receive the intended benefits. For instance, if
            Salaryfy provides courses on specific subjects, the limited license
            rights will ensure that the users use the courses for educational
            purposes only, and not for any other reason.

            ensures that the users are not exposed to any risks or liabilities.
            For instance, if the company provides skill placement services, the
            limited license rights will ensure that the users use the services
            in a manner that does not expose them to any legal or financial
            liabilities.
